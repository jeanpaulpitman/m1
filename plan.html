</section>
<section>
	<h1>Success Evaluation</h1>
	<p>Success evaluation will be measured as a direct increase in online membership sales, and Orchestra attendance numbers. Currently, Orchestra ticket sales are outsourced to Ticketshop with Barrier Reef Orchestra receiving a share of the ticket sales for each performance. Whereas, Membership sales is handled inhouse from the current website.</p>
	<p>Both Membership sales, and Orchestra Attendance revenue streams allow quantifiable measurements to track revenue increase. It is expected the Goal of a combined 50% revenue increase be reached within twelve months for the website to be deemed successful.</p>
