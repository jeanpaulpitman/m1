						<h2>Who is BRO?</h2>
						<p>Barrier Reef Orchestra (BRO) is a product of North Queensland Ensembles Inc. North Queensland Ensembles Inc. is an Incorporated Association registered in the State of Queensland. It is also a tax deductible fund listed on the Register of Cultural Organisations under Subdivision 30-B of the Income tax Assessment Act 1997. It is based in Townsville, North Queensland, Australia.</p>
						<h2>History of the Orchestra</h2>
						<p>Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who had a love for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra — one that would flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.</p>
						<p>In 2000 to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and musicians were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School of Music and the result — the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born.</p>
						<p>In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc, performs three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. Smaller ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra.</p>
						<p>During the next few years the Orchestra performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in Score, Townsville City Council’s Last Night of the Proms and A Christmas Carol.</p>
						<h3>BRO, Through the Years</h3>
						<button class="accordion">2015</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p>2015 was our 15 year anniversary and featured several concerts that highlighted not only the enhanced quality of musical performance from the orchestra but an increasing recognition from our audience, benefactors and the wider community. In May BRO was asked to perform at the Townsville ARTS Awards, a first for the orchestra, with a selection from Frozen, not your standard repertoire but well received by the audience and an indication that the orchestra can is and capable of taking on a diverse range of music. This was to be a feature in the last 12 months.</p>
							<p>August was another first for BRO as were invited to perform at a free public concert as part of the Australian Festival of Chamber Music. Supported by Townsville City Council and featuring other ensembles such as 1RAR band and Camerata of St. John’s string ensemble. The performance culminated in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture Op.49 with a twist. Involving the audience simulating the cannons with paper bags and car keys…. you had to be there. The audience was in excess of 4000 and proved very popular. So much so we have been invited back for another performance in 2016. Thank you Justin.</p>
							<p>As is often the case rehearsals for the World Music Concert were well under way prior to the AFCM concert. World Music Concert offered a music tour of the world featuring Adam Lopez (Vocalist), Domenico Tarraborrelli on Accordion and David Hudson on digeridoo, vocals and guitar. Audio/Visual was used throughout the concert and several of the arrangements were specifically written for the performance. As it involved 21 pieces of music and extra musicians for 1RAR and further afield. Sally our Orchestra Manager had her work cut out for her and I am pleased to say rose to the challenge. I had the privilege to produce direct and conduct the performance. After the performance which was well received by the audience, given the letters and feedback we received, we had a big exhale at completing such a mammoth task.</p>
							<p>This concert was hired in by Townsville Civic Theatre, another first for BRO. As was our next performance which was a collaboration with Dancenorth in their presentation of a unique work titled Twilight written and directed by Ng Chor Guan an international artist and located on the headlands of Kissing Point. It involved elements of BRO Brass section performing music in response to the environment. With no music written it was up the musicians to play given limited guidelines; certainly a challenge for those of us who are used to using written music. From all reports it was particularly effective.</p>
							<p>Rounding out the year was A Musical Feast in November conducted by Mark Shiell. Mark commented that he thought the orchestra and improved musically since he last worked with the BRO, pleasing feedback from a professional. A potpourri of music that was enjoyed by all. 2016 was soon upon us commencing with the launch at the Pier restaurant with a performance from the Strings and a last minute addition of soprano Siobhan Patrick, a spell binding performance that I think will lead to further collaborations with her. The launch also allowed me to reinforce our Commitment to TPAC (www.tpac.net.au) while we had the Mayor’s full attention. This continues to be an ongoing concern that requires all of us to push TPAC forward at every opportunity.</p>

						<div class="panel">
							<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue from tickets up for 2013. The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 months.</p>
							<p>This included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf. The concert was well received by the audience and the Orchestra got into the mood by dressing up appropriately for their musical characters.</p>
							<p>Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin. Sadly the Burdekin concert was not well attended despite the best efforts in advertising and extra signage.</p>
							<p>Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre. As expected the audience join in with the antics.</p>
