CP1406/CP1806 - Group Website Project
In the project, CP1406 students will work together as part of a team to create a website doing the planning, design, production, usability testing and publishing, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project will require research, self-directed learning, teamwork and consultation with your lecturer.
The project is to (re)develop a site for the Barrier Reef Orchestra (BRO). You will be provided with some content and a reasonable idea of the goals and target audience. Part of this is provided as a recording of a client presentation and discussion, which you need to watch in order to understand the client and task. 

Important: The old (existing) BRO site (http://www.nqorchestra.com.au) should give you an idea of content but NOT design or information architecture. Plan and design the site mostly as if the old site did not exist. If the old site were fine the way it is now, we wouldn’t be making a new site. Please ask any questions about this assignment on the slack channel for our subject or email the lecturer directly.

You have two separate milestones as part of this one project. These are summarised here with further details below:

Milestone 1 - Project Plan & Design Comps (10%, due week 10)
Create a project plan (including goal and audience analysis, flowchart, text, images and screen designs), which your group will continue developing to make the finished site.

Milestone 2 - Finished Product (30%, due week 13)
This is the full, finished product website, the result of your team going through the complete website design and development process. Use the project plan to develop a functional, finished site. Your site should be “completed” by week 12, so that it is ready for usability testing. Assessment of this milestone is for both completeness and quality.

Finished site components at a minimum are:
Important: The requirements here are not specified as pages, but as features or functionality. 
The information architecture is up to you to decide and the page/feature titles (e.g. “bulletin board”) are also able to be changed. E.g. the old site has a separate sponsors page, but you might like to combine this with the contact or about us page, or whatever you think is best as a result of careful consideration in your planning.

Home Page with content written to rank well on search engines (including meta data)

Artists (Musicians):
•	display all artists (list) - short information text and a small image
•	featured artist (highlighted appropriately)
•	clicking on an artist should load another page to display more detail and a larger image

Events:
•	display all events (list), sorted by date (soonest first)
•	events featuring a registered artist should link to that artist’s page

Bulletin Board:
•	each notice should have an expiry date and may have an external link

Membership Registration:
•	this should describe registration and membership benefits and allow users to sign up online using details from the Word doc form on the old site, but handled all online
•	users should use their email as login and create a password
•	you do not need to handle any payments for membership, but can simply link to PayPal as on the old site.
•	your registration page does not need to work, but should display properly and be set up so that it could be made to work easily in the future (e.g. name your fields properly)

One “Feeder” Page - this is a content page designed to capture users looking for something related (music) and feed them back into the site.

Plus: contact information, sponsor details and information about the organisation
